I act as a bridge between **vague business problems** and **efficient digital logic**. By leveraging **Advanced Prompt Engineering** alongside Full-Stack Development, I accelerate the software lifecycle—transitioning from MVP Conceptualization to Deployment with a **40% reduction in time-to-market**.

Currently, I serve as a **Data Management Associate** at **Luxury Global Malls (Megaworld Subsidiary)**, architecting the internal operations ecosystem.

## ⚡ My "Logic-First" Philosophy
I believe that code is just a tool to solve a logic puzzle. My competitive advantage is **Efficiency**.

> *"I use Advanced Prompt Engineering (Chain of Thought & Few-Shot prompting) not to replace the developer, but to give the developer a jetpack. I architect the logic, AI handles the syntax, and we ship solutions faster."*
